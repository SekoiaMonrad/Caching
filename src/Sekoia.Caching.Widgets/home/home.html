    <h2>How to use this application template</h2>
    <p>This template is intended for creating wigdet micro services.</p>
    <p>
        A menu is automatically constructed from all pages located in scaffolds, and the structure should be as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                /scaffolds
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        /menu1
                        <ul>
                            <li>/menuitem11</li>
                            <li>/menuitem12</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        /menu2
                        <ul>
                            <li>/menuitem21</li>
                            <li>/menuitem22</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Meaning that a dropdown menu will be created for each folder under scaffolds
        and a menu item will be created for each folder within those folders.
        The viewmodel file is expected to be named after menuitem folder.
    </p>

        folder which follow <a href="http://durandaljs.com/documentation/Creating-A-Widget.html">Durandal2s default widget structure</a>.
